<strong>Lorem ipsum</strong> is the nonsense filler text that typically demonstrates the font and style of a text in a document or visual demonstration. Originally from <strong><em>Latin</em></strong>, lorem ipsum has no intelligible meaning, but is simply a display of letters and characteristics to be viewed as a sample with given graphical elements in a file. <strong>Lipsum</strong> (portmanteau of lorem and ipsum) generators are commonly used to form generic text in a file. <ins>The “gibberish” is adequately like normal text to demonstrate a font</ins>, but does not distract the reader with its content. It has been used as placeholder text since the 16th century.
